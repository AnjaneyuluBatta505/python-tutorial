# Python operators

## Arithmetic Operators

1. Write program to take two numbers from the user and perform below operations.
    1. addition (`+`)
    2. subtraction (`-`)
    3. multiplication (`*`)
    4. division (`/`)
2. Write a program to take width and breadth of a rectange from the user and calculate area and permimeter of rectangle. 
3. Write a program to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa using the following formulas:

    Celsius to Fahrenheit: F = (C * 9/5) + 32
    Fahrenheit to Celsius: C = (F - 32) * 5/9

4. Write a program to calculate the simple interest for a given principal amount, rate of interest, and time period using the formula:

    Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100
5. Write a program to calculate the compound interest for a given principal amount, rate of interest, and time period using the formula:

    Compound Interest = Principal * ((1 + Rate/100)^Time) - Principal

6. Write a program to calculate BMI using the following formula:

    BMI = (Weight in kilograms) / (Height in meters)^2

7. Write a program that takes the coordinates of two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) as input and calculates the distance between them using the distance formula:

    Distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
8. Write a program to check whether a given number is even or odd using the modulo (%) operator.
9. Write a program to check whether a given year is a leap year or not using arithmetic operators.

## Comparison Operators

1. Write a program to take two numbers i.e `num1` and `num2` from the user and compare `num1` and `num2` using operator `>` and print the output.
2. Write a program to take two numbers i.e `num1` and `num2` from the user and compare `num1` and `num2` using operator `<` and print the output.
3. Write a program to take two numbers i.e `num1` and `num2` from the user and compare `num1` and `num2` using operator `>=` and print the output.
4. Write a program to take two numbers i.e `num1` and `num2` from the user and compare `num1` and `num2` using operator `<=` and print the output.
5. Write a program to take two strings i.e `s1` and `s2` from the user and compare `s1` and `s2` using operator `>` and print the output.
6. Write a program to take two strings i.e `s1` and `s2` from the user and compare `s1` and `s2` using operator `<` and print the output.
7. Write a program to take two strings i.e `s1` and `s2` from the user and compare `s1` and `s2` using operator `<=` and print the output.
8. Write a program to take two strings i.e `s1` and `s2` from the user and compare `s1` and `s2` using operator `>=` and print the output.

## Assignment Operators

1. Write a program to create a variable named `name` and assign value `Abdul Kalam`.
2. Write a program to take a number from the user and increase it by 3 and print the output.
3. Write a program to take a number from the user and decrease it by 5 and print the output.
4. Write a program to take a number from the user and multiply it by 2 and print the output.
5. Write a program to take a number from the user and devide it by 4 and print the output.
6. Write a program to take a number from the user and devide it by 3 and find the reminder and print the output.
7. Write a program to take a number from the user and devide it by 5 and find the quotient and print the output.
8. Write a program to take a number from the user and increase it to the power of 2 and print the output.

> Note: Only use one variable to store the output.

## Logical Operators

1. Write a program to check if a given number is both even and greater than 10.
2. Write a program to take a alphabet letter from the user and check if a user's input is a vowel i.e one of `('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')`.
3. Write a program to take a number from the user and check if the given number is either divisible by 2 or 3 but not both.

> Note: print `True` if it's divisible by 2 or 3 otherwise `False`
