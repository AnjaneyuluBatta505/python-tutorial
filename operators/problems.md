# Python operators

## Arithmetic Operators

1. Write program to take two numbers from the user and perform below operations.
    1. addition (`+`)
    2. subtraction (`-`)
    3. multiplication (`*`)
    4. division (`/`)
2. Write a program to take width and breadth of a rectange from the user and calculate area and permimeter of rectangle. 
3. Write a program to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa using the following formulas:

    Celsius to Fahrenheit: F = (C * 9/5) + 32
    Fahrenheit to Celsius: C = (F - 32) * 5/9

4. Write a program to calculate the simple interest for a given principal amount, rate of interest, and time period using the formula:

    Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100
5. Write a program to calculate the compound interest for a given principal amount, rate of interest, and time period using the formula:

    Compound Interest = Principal * ((1 + Rate/100)^Time) - Principal

6. Write a program to calculate BMI using the following formula:

    BMI = (Weight in kilograms) / (Height in meters)^2

7. Write a program that takes the coordinates of two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) as input and calculates the distance between them using the distance formula:

    Distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
8. Write a program to check whether a given number is even or odd using the modulo (%) operator.
9. Write a program to check whether a given year is a leap year or not using arithmetic operators.

## Comparison Operators
1. Write a program to take two numbers from the user and compare the numbers and print if they are equal.
2. Write a program to take two numbers from the user and compare the numbers and print if one is greater than the other.
3. Write a program to take two strings from the user and compare the strings and check if they are equal ignoring the case.
4. Write a program to take two numbers i.e `num1` and `num2` from the user. Also, take one more number from the user i.e `num3` and check if the number is between the given numbers i.e `num1` and `num2`.
