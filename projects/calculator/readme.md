# Calculator Requirements Specification Document

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the functional and non-functional requirements for a simple calculator application. The calculator will perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 1.2 Scope
The calculator will be a standalone application with a graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI). It will support integer and floating-point operations, along with additional features such as memory storage and history tracking.

## 2. Functional Requirements
### 2.1 Basic Arithmetic Operations
- The calculator shall support the following operations:
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-)
  - Multiplication (*)
  - Division (/)

### 2.2 Advanced Operations (Optional)
- The calculator may support:
  - Exponentiation (^)
  - Square root (âˆš)
  - Modulus (%)

### 2.3 Input Handling
- The calculator shall accept numerical input from the user.
- The calculator shall support both integer and floating-point numbers.
- The calculator shall validate user input and display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.

### 2.4 Memory Functions
- The calculator shall provide the ability to store and recall a single numeric value.
- The calculator shall allow users to clear stored memory.

### 2.5 Calculation History
- The calculator shall maintain a history of recent calculations.
- The history should be viewable and clearable by the user.

### 2.6 User Interface
- The application shall have a simple and intuitive interface.
- The GUI version shall have buttons for digits, operations, and memory functions.
- The CLI version shall allow operations via textual commands.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Performance
- The calculator shall perform all calculations within 100 milliseconds.
- The application shall handle at least 10,000 operations without significant performance degradation.

### 3.2 Usability
- The calculator shall be user-friendly and easy to navigate.
- The interface shall follow standard calculator design principles.

### 3.3 Reliability
- The application shall be available with 99.9% uptime.
- The calculator shall provide meaningful error messages when encountering division by zero or invalid inputs.

### 3.4 Security
- The application shall not allow execution of arbitrary code.
- The stored memory and history shall be protected from unauthorized access.

## 4. Constraints
- The calculator shall be developed using Python.
- The GUI version shall be implemented using Tkinter or PyQt.
- The CLI version shall be compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## 5. Assumptions and Dependencies
- The application assumes that users have basic knowledge of arithmetic operations.
- The project depends on Python 3.6 or later.
- External libraries (if used) must be properly documented.

## 6. Future Enhancements
- Support for scientific functions (e.g., logarithms, trigonometry)
- Support for graphing functions
- Multi-user support with persistent history storage

## 7. Conclusion
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of a simple calculator application. The implementation shall focus on accuracy, usability, and performance while ensuring a user-friendly experience.
