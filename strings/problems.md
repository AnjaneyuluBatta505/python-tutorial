# Python strings

1. write a program to define strings in different ways.
    1. using single quote i.e `'`
    2. using double quote i.e `"`
    3. multiline string
2. write program to take `first_name` and `last_name` from the user and print the full name.
3. write a program to take user `full_name` and find length of the `full_name`.
4. write a program to take a `sentense` and `word` from the user and check whether the `word` is substring of the `sentense` or not.
5. write a program to take a two strings from the user and check if `string2` is not in `string1`.
6. Guess the output for the below program
   ```python
   s = "Python is awesome!"
   print(s[2:5])
   print(s[:5])
   print(s[2:])
   print(s[-5:-2])
   print(s[::-1])
   ```
7. write a program to take a string from the user and capitalize it.
8. write a program to take string from the user and convert it to lower case.
9. write a program to take `string1` and `string2` and find total number of occurences of `string2` in `string1`.
10. write a program to take word from the user and check if it ends with `ing`.
11. write a program to center string "wow" with length of 20.
12. write a program to reverse a given string
    > Note: use slice notation
13. Write a program to check if a given string is a palindrome or not.
14. write a program to find length of the string.
15. write aprogram to join below list of strings with "->".
    ```python
    l = ["python", "strings", "join"]
    ```
16. write a program to convert a string to uppercase, lowercase, and title case.
17. write a program to remove leading and trailing whitespace from a string.
18. write a program to find the index of the first occurrence of a substring within a string.
    > Note: take `string` and `substring` from the user.
19. write program to check if a string starts or ends with a specified substring.
    > Note: use string methods `startswith()` and `endswith()`
20. write a program to check if given string has only alphabets.
21. write a program to check if given string has only alphabets and numbers.
