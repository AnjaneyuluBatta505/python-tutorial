# Python - if...elif...else

1. Write a program that takes a percentage as input and outputs the corresponding letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F).

   percentage >= 90 and percentage <= 100 then grade is "A"

   percentage >= 80 and percentage < 90 then grade is "B"

   percentage >= 70 and percentage < 80 then grade is "C"

   percentage >= 60 and percentage < 70 then grade is "D"

   percentage < 60 then grade is "F"

   Consider the follwing test cases

   **Test1**

   ```
   Input: 98.2
   Output: A
   ```

   **Test2**

   ```
   Input: 58.2
   Output: F
   ```

2. Write a program that classifies a person's age into categories like infant, child, teenager, adult, or senior based on user input.

   **Infant**: the ages of 0 and 1
   **Child**: between the ages of 1 and 12
   **Teenager**: between the ages of 13 and 17
   **Adult**: between the ages of 18 and 60
   **Senior**: whose age is more than 60

   Consider the follwing test cases

   **Test1**

   ```
   Input: 0.5
   Output: Infant
   ```

   **Test2**

   ```
   Input: 18
   Output: Adult
   ```

3. Write a program that takes two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) as input and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation

   Consider the follwing test cases

   **Test1**

   ```
   Input:
       number1: 15
       number2: 5
       operator: +
   Output: 20
   ```

   **Test2**

   ```
   Input:
       number1: 15
       number2: 5
       operator: *
   Output: 75
   ```

   **Test3**

   ```
   Input:
       number1: 15
       number2: 5
       operator: wow
   Output: Invalid operator
   ```

4. Write a python program that takes an integer from the user and print "Fizz" if it's divisible by 3, print "Buzz" if it's divisible by 5 and print "FizzBuzz" if it's divisible by both 3 and 5.

   Consider the follwing test cases

   **Test1**

   ```
   Input: 6
   Output: Fizz
   ```

   **Test2**

   ```
   Input: 10
   Output: Buzz
   ```

   **Test3**

   ```
   Input: 15
   Output: FizzBuzz
   ```

5. Write a program to find the maximum string among three given string inputs.

   Consider the follwing test cases

   **Test1**

   ```
   Input:
   str1: wow
   str2: awesome
   str3: python
   Output: awesome
   ```

   **Test2**

   ```
   Input:
   str1: Elephant
   str2: Guitar
   str3: Laptop
   Output: Elephant
   ```
