# Python Numbers

1. write a program to find the area of a circle.
2. write a program to take three numbers from the user and find the average of the numbers.
3. write a program to take a number from the user and convert it to float and print the output.
4. write a program to take a number from the user and convert it to integer and print the output.
5. write a program to find the sum of n natural numbers by taking input `n` from the user.
    
    > Note: sum = ( num * ( num + 1 ) ) / 2

6. write a program to find sum of below complex numbers.

    ```
    x = 3+5j
    y = 5j
    z = -5j
    ```
7. write a program to find the data type using `type` built-in function for below data.
    ```python
    num1 = 100
    num2 = 123.67
    num3 = 4+6j
    ```
8. write a program to take parts `a`, `b` of a complex number i.e `a+bj` and create the complex number.
    > Note: use `complex` built-in function.
9. write a program to take two digit number from the user and reverse it.
