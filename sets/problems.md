# Python - Sets

1. write a python program to create an empty set named `numbers`.
2. write a python program to create a set named `numbers` with elements `1, 2, 3`.
3. write a python program to create a set named `numbers` with elements `1, 2, 3` and new element `100` to it.
4. write a python program to create a set named `numbers` with elements `1, 2, 3` and remove element `2` from it.
5. write a python program to create a set named `numbers` with elements `1, 2, 3` and check if element `2` is in it.
6. write a python program to find the length of the set.
    > Note: `names = {"anji", "john", "laxmi", "vishnu"}`
7. write a python program to remove all elements from the set.
    > Note: `names = {"anji", "john", "laxmi", "vishnu"}`
8. write a python program to find the union of two sets i.e `s1`, `s2`.
    ```python
    s1 = {"Anji", "John", "Laxmi", "Vishnu"}
    s2 = {"David", "Jimmy", "Shiva", "Laxmi", "Vishnu"}
    ```
9. write a python program to find the intersection of two sets i.e `s1`, `s2`.
    ```python
    s1 = {"Anji", "John", "Laxmi", "Vishnu"}
    s2 = {"David", "Jimmy", "Shiva", "Laxmi", "Vishnu"}
    ```
10. write a python program to find the difference of two sets i.e `s1`, `s2`.
    ```python
      s1 = {"Anji", "John", "Laxmi", "Vishnu"}
      s2 = {"David", "Jimmy", "Shiva", "Laxmi", "Vishnu"}
    ```
11. write a python program to check if `s1` is subset of `s2` and vice versa.
    ```python
    s1 = {"Laxmi", "Vishnu"}
    s2 = {"David", "Jimmy", "Shiva", "Laxmi", "Vishnu"}
    ```
12. write a python program to check if `s1` is superset of `s2` and vice versa.
    ```python
    s1 = {"Laxmi", "Vishnu"}
    s2 = {"David", "Jimmy", "Shiva", "Laxmi", "Vishnu"}
    ```
