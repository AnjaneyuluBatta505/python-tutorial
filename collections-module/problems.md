# Python - Collections Module

## namedtuple
1. Create a namedtuple called `Point` to represent a 2D point with `x` and `y` coordinates. Instantiate it and print the coordinates.
2. Extend the `Point` namedtuple to a 3D point by adding a `z` coordinate.
3. Write a function that calculates the distance between two `Point` namedtuples.
4. Create a namedtuple called `Rectangle` to represent a rectangle with `width` and `height` attributes. Write a method to compute the area.
5. Write a function to check if a given point is inside a rectangle defined by two points (bottom-left and top-right corners).
6. Create a namedtuple called `Student` with `name`, `age`, and `grade`. Write a function to return students with grades above a certain threshold.
7. Write a function to sort a list of `Student` namedtuples by their grades in descending order.
8. Create a namedtuple called `Car` with `make`, `model`, and `year`. Write a function to filter cars older than a given year.
9. Write a function to convert a list of dictionaries to a list of `namedtuple` objects.
10. Create a namedtuple called `Employee` with `name`, `position`, and `salary`. Write a method to give a raise to an employee.

## dequeue

11.  Create a `deque` of integers from 1 to 10. Perform and print the results of basic operations: append, appendleft, pop, and popleft.
12.  Write a function to rotate a `deque` n steps to the right.
13.  Implement a queue using a `deque`. Provide methods for enqueue and dequeue.
14.  Implement a stack using a `deque`. Provide methods for push and pop.
15.  Write a function to reverse the elements in a `deque`.
16.  Write a function to find the maximum and minimum elements in a `deque`.
17.  Implement a sliding window maximum function using a `deque`.
18.  Write a function to remove all instances of a given value from a `deque`.
19.  Create a `deque` and perform insert operations at both ends. Print the final `deque`.
20.  Write a function to merge two deques into one.
