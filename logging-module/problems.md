# Python logging module

1. **Basic Logging Setup** – Create a simple script that logs messages at different severity levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`).  
2. **Rotating Log Files** – Implement rotating logs using `RotatingFileHandler` to limit log file size and create backups.  
3. **Time-based Log Rotation** – Use `TimedRotatingFileHandler` to rotate logs daily, hourly, or at custom intervals.  
4. **Logging to Multiple Destinations** – Configure logging to write messages to both the console and a file simultaneously.  
5. **Custom Log Formatting** – Modify log message format to include timestamps, log levels, and module names.  
6. **Logging Exceptions** – Automatically log exceptions with stack traces using `logging.exception()` inside a try-except block.  
7. **JSON Log Formatter** – Create a custom log formatter that outputs log messages in JSON format.  
8. **Log Filtering** – Implement a custom log filter to log only messages from a specific module or function.  
9. **Logging in a Multi-Threaded Application** – Set up logging for a multi-threaded program, ensuring thread-safe log writes.  
10. **Centralized Logging System** – Send logs to a remote server or a centralized logging service (e.g., ELK stack, Graylog).  
11. **Logging API Requests and Responses** – Log HTTP requests and responses in a web application (Flask/Django).  
12. **Logging Database Transactions** – Log queries and database interactions in a database-driven application.  
13. **Debugging Performance Issues** – Use logging to measure execution time for different parts of a script.  
14. **Email Alerts for Critical Errors** – Configure `SMTPHandler` to send emails when a critical error occurs.  
15. **Logging User Activity** – Track user actions in an application (e.g., login attempts, file uploads).  
16. **Structured Logging with Context Variables** – Use `extra` parameter in logs to add contextual metadata.  
17. **Logging in a Microservices Architecture** – Implement logging across multiple microservices using a shared logging format.  
18. **Custom Logging Handlers** – Create a custom handler that logs messages to a database or an external service.  
19. **Analyzing Log Data** – Write a script to parse and analyze log files for patterns, errors, and insights.  
20. **Secure Logging** – Implement log sanitization to prevent sensitive data from appearing in logs.
