5. **Find the difference between two dates**
   - Subtract two dates and print the difference in days.

6. **Add and subtract days from a date**

10. **Convert UTC time to local time**
    - Use `timezone` from `datetime` to convert UTC time to a specific timezone.

11. **Measure execution time of a function**
    - Use `datetime` to measure how long a function takes to execute.

12. **Find the day of the week for any date**
    - Write a function that returns the day (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for a given date.

13. **Schedule an event after a certain time**
